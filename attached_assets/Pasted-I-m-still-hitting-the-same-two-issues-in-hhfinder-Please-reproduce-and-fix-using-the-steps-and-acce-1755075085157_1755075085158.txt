I’m still hitting the same two issues in hhfinder. Please reproduce and fix using the steps and acceptance criteria below.

Context

    When I start a new search via the “New Search” button from Steps 1/2/3/4, Step 4 still shows stale results from the previous search until I log out/in.

    My Applications on the Home page still doesn’t show auto-saved items after I complete a flow.

How to reproduce (please do it exactly like this)

    Log in.

    Step 1: enter учитель русского языка → continue to Step 4 and browse a few vacancies.

    Now, without going Home, click “New Search” (from whichever step you’re on) and enter English.

    Go to Step 4 again.

    Also, go to Home → My Applications.

Actual behavior

    Step 4 still shows the old учитель русского языка results after the “New Search” flow.

    My Applications remains empty (no auto-saved record appears).

What I expect

    Hitting “New Search” from ANY step fully resets the search run:

        a new client signature is generated,

        the wizard state is cleared (including any persisted state),

        and React Query cache for the previous run is invalidated/removed.

        Result: Step 4 shows only fresh results for the new keywords, with no stale items, and no logout/login needed.

    My Applications shows auto-saved items according to the intended design (see below).

What to verify while reproducing

    In DevTools → Network, confirm requests after starting the new search carry a different client signature than the previous search.

    In server logs, the 🔍 [search_*] Client Signature: lines must change when the new search starts.

    In Home → My Applications, I should see the auto-saved item(s) after finishing a run.

Likely root cause / where to fix

    The “New Search” button handler does not fully reset the state and caches when used from Steps 1–4. It should:

        Generate a new search/client signature immediately upon “New Search”.

        Reset the wizard store (Zustand) and clear its persisted slice so no stale keywords/filters/step index remain.

        Invalidate/remove React Query data tied to the previous signature and generic vacancy queries (so nothing from the old run leaks).

    Auto-save / My Applications:

        Confirm when an application record is created (on first view in Step 4, on “Save”, or on “Apply”?).

        If auto-save on Step 4 is intended, ensure the UI actually triggers the create call (e.g., POST /api/applications) and that it succeeds (look for 201/200 in logs).

        If auto-save is not intended, update the UI text and provide a clear “Save” action the user can take, and verify it creates a record that appears on Home.

Diagnostics to add (temporary)

    Log on every “New Search” click: NewSearch clicked at step X, old signature=..., new signature=...

    Log after state reset: Wizard reset complete; persisted store cleared

    Log after cache clear: React Query invalidated: <keys>

    When creating an application: log the exact request: POST /api/applications with payload summary and response status.

Acceptance criteria

    After pressing “New Search” from any step and entering new keywords, Step 4 shows fresh results only (no items from the previous query). This works without reload or logout.

    Client signature changes on each new search; old queries are not reused.

    Wizard persisted state is cleared on “New Search” (keywords/filters/step index reset).

    My Applications shows entries according to the decided behavior:

        If auto-save is intended, I can finish a run and see a new item on Home without extra clicks.

        If explicit saving is intended, there is a visible Save action in Step 4, and using it adds an entry that appears on Home.

    Provide the test evidence:

        Console screenshot of “NewSearch clicked…” and changed signature,

        Network HAR (showing new signature on requests),

        Server log snippet showing POST /api/applications (or a clear UI hint if explicit save is required).

Please confirm:

    The exact intended rule for populating “My Applications” (auto-save vs manual save),

    The component(s) updated for the “New Search” button so it fully resets both persisted wizard state and React Query cache,

    And that all four steps now use the same, fixed reset behavior.
