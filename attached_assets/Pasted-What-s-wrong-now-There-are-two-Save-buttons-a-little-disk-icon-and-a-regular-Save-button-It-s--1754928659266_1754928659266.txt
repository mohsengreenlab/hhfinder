What’s wrong now:
There are two Save buttons (a little disk icon and a regular “Save” button). It’s confusing. Also, my last chosen prompt isn’t remembered when I move to the next vacancy.

What I want:

    One Save flow

    Remove the duplicate Save controls.

    Keep a single, clear button: “Save your prompt” (under the text area).

    When clicked, if the prompt doesn’t have a name yet, show a small name field (or a mini dialog) right there: “Prompt name” → Save.

    After saving, the new prompt appears in the dropdown and is auto-selected.

    Manage saved prompts

    In the same dropdown where I pick a prompt, let me delete any of my saved prompts (with a quick “Are you sure?”).

    Optional but nice: allow rename; not required if it complicates things.

    Prevent exact duplicate names, or ask if I want to overwrite when I use an existing name.

    Remember my last choice

    Whatever I used last (a default prompt or a custom/saved prompt) should stick when I go to the next vacancy and when I come back later.

    In other words: don’t reset to “Custom Prompt” automatically. Keep the same selection and the same text unless I change it.

    Per-user saving

    Saved prompts and the “last used prompt” setting should be stored in the database for the logged-in user, so they persist across logouts and new sessions.

    Small UX touches

    Show a short success toast after saving or deleting.

    If the browser blocks anything or a save fails, show a friendly error and don’t lose my text.

    Keep the token chips ({{POSITION}}, {{COMPANY}}, etc.) working as they do now.

Success checklist:

    Only one Save button is visible and it clearly says “Save your prompt.”

    I can name and save a prompt; it appears in the dropdown immediately.

    I can delete past prompts from the same dropdown (with confirmation).

    My last chosen prompt (default or custom) is remembered for the next vacancy and future sessions.

    All saved prompts and the last-used selection are stored per user in the database.
