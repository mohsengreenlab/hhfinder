Please add private, invite-only user login and session continuity to my AI job search app.
What I want

    Private login (no public sign-ups)

    Only I, the admin, can create and manage accounts.

    I need a simple way to add, edit, or deactivate users (username + password).

    Make it easy for me to update the list without deploying code again (for example: a small admin screen protected by my own admin login, or a simple “users list” I can edit safely).

    Users should log in with a username and password. If the password is wrong, show a friendly error.

    Keep it secure and private. This site is invite-only.

    Pick up where you left off

    After logging in, show a welcome screen with two big choices:

        Continue my last application

        Start a new search

    If the user has ongoing work, “Continue” should jump straight back into the 4-step flow at the exact step they left, with all their previous inputs intact (keywords, selected suggestions, filters, and the current vacancy they were viewing).

    If the user chooses “Start a new search,” begin a fresh flow from Step 1, but keep a record of past applications so they can return to them later.

    Progress that really sticks

    Save each user’s progress automatically as they move through the wizard (step number, selected keywords, filters toggled on/off and their values, and the current vacancy index).

    If the user closes the browser or comes back days later, they can continue seamlessly.

    Keep the current design and tone of the app. Use the same style for buttons and headings (simple, friendly language).

    A simple “My Applications” page

    Give users a small page or panel listing their past searches/applications with:

        A short title (e.g., “Frontend roles in Moscow”),

        The date last edited,

        Buttons: Continue, View, and Start similar search.

    “Continue” reopens the exact step and context.

    “Start similar search” copies the old settings into a new run so users can tweak and go.

    Admin needs

    I can log in as admin and:

        Add a new user (username + password),

        Reset a user’s password,

        Deactivate or delete a user,

        See when a user last signed in and whether they have in-progress work.

    Keep the admin area simple and safe. It’s only for me.

    User experience details

    After login failure, show one clear error message with a retry.

    After logout, send users back to the login screen.

    If a user has no previous work, hide or disable the “Continue” option and explain why (“No previous application found yet”).

    Use plain language throughout: “Log in,” “Continue,” “Start a new search,” “My applications,” “Log out.”

Success checklist

    I (admin) can add a user, share the credentials, and that user can log in.

    A user can log in, start the wizard, close the app, come back, choose Continue, and land exactly where they left off with the same data.

    A user can see a short list of their past applications and reopen any of them.

    I (admin) can reset passwords and deactivate accounts.

    Styling matches the current app and feels native.

If anything is unclear, make reasonable choices that keep this private, simple, and secure, and stick to everyday language in the interface.
