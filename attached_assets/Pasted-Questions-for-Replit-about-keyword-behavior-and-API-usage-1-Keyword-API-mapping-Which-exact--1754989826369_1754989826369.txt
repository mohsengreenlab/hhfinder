Questions for Replit about keyword behavior and API usage
1) Keyword → API mapping

    Which exact HH.ru API endpoint(s) does Step 4’s job search use after I pick keywords in Step 2?

    Are the selected keywords passed to the API as:

        A text parameter (full-text search)?

        A list of keyword IDs from HH.ru’s /suggests/vacancy_search_keyword endpoint?

        Another parameter (like search_field, specialization, etc.)?

    Are these keywords searched only in the job title, or also in job descriptions, skills, employer names, etc.?

    Does the API treat them as AND (all keywords must match) or OR (any keyword match) logic?

2) AI suggestion verification step

    When the AI generates keywords in Step 1, you mentioned they are “verified through HH.ru’s API” — how exactly is this verification done?

    Does the app store the keyword ID returned from HH.ru, or just the text string?

    If I manually select/deselect keywords, does that change the IDs or only the text sent to HH.ru?

3) Search field scope

    Are there specific search fields being passed (e.g., name, description, company_name, skills) in the API request?

    If so, are all fields enabled, or only some?

    Can we configure which fields to search in?

4) Filter interaction

    Do Step 3 filters (education level, work format, etc.) narrow down the results from the keyword search, or do they apply independently?

    Is there a default set of filters even when all checkboxes are off?

5) Caching and refresh

    Is there any local or server-side caching that might show me stale results after keyword changes?

    When I change keywords, does the app always trigger a fresh API call to HH.ru, or does it sometimes reuse cached data?

6) Testing the actual request

    Can you show me a real example of the final request URL and payload that’s sent to HH.ru after I:

        Select a certain set of keywords in Step 2

        Apply certain filters in Step 3

        Click “Next” to go to Step 4?
