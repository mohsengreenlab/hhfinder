Task: Enforce forward-only flow (Back = New Search)
Goal

Make the wizard strictly forward only. There is no going back to earlier steps. Any “back” action (buttons, stepper clicks, browser back) should be treated as starting a New Search (full reset → Step 1). Users can only change keywords/filters before they reach Step 4; once on Step 4, adjustments require a New Search.
What changes

    Remove all back navigation across Steps 2, 3, and 4:

        No “Back” buttons.

        Stepper/crumbs should not allow clicking previous steps.

        Any UI hint that suggests going back must be removed.

    “Refine filters” on Step 4 stays removed (already requested).

    Keep “New Search” visible on Steps 2–4. “New Search” = full reset of the current search and route to Step 1.

Behavior rules

    Forward only

        Users can move Step 1 → 2 → 3 → 4.

        There is no navigation to earlier steps.

    Back equals New Search

        If the user triggers any “back-like” action (including browser Back), show confirm:

            “Start a new search? Your current progress will be cleared. We only save once you reach Step 4.”

        If confirmed → fully reset and route to Step 1.

        If canceled → stay on the current step.

    Saving policy (unchanged intent)

        No saving on Steps 1–3.

        Start saving only at Step 4.

        If a user was already on Step 4 (saved search) and starts a New Search, that creates a new search only after they reach Step 4 again. Past searches remain untouched.

    Step 4 editing

        On Step 4, there is no way to alter keywords or filters directly or by going back.

        Show a small hint if needed: “To change keywords or filters, start a New Search.”

    Deep links & direct URLs

        If someone tries to open an earlier step for a saved search, redirect to Step 4 with a notice: “This search is read-only for viewing. Start a New Search to change settings.”

        For unsaved (pre-Step-4) work, allow Step 2/3 direct entry, but still no back to earlier steps; “New Search” is the only reset path.

State & reset (high level)

    New Search / Back confirm → full reset of the in-progress search:

        Clear keywords, expansions, negative words, toggles.

        Clear all filters.

        Clear step 4 viewer state (index, generated letter, etc.).

        Invalidate/remove any cached search results.

        Remove per-search local persistence.

        Keep global user preferences/settings.

    Auto-save is gated by “hasReachedStep4=true” as already implemented.

Copy updates (simple language)

    Confirm dialog:
    “Start a new search? Your current progress will be cleared. We only save once you reach Step 4.”

    Step 4 helper (optional, small text):
    “Want different results? Start a New Search to change keywords or filters.”

    Empty state on Step 4:
    “No results for these settings. Start a New Search to try different keywords or filters.”

Acceptance criteria

    There is no Back action anywhere in the wizard UI (desktop or mobile).

    Clicking older steps in the stepper does nothing or opens the New Search confirm (choose one consistent behavior); it never navigates back.

    Pressing the browser Back shows the New Search confirm; confirm resets to Step 1; cancel stays.

    “Refine filters” is absent from Step 4, and the header/toolbar looks clean and aligned.

    Results always refresh correctly when reaching Step 4 after a New Search (no stale data).

    No data is saved before Step 4; saving starts only at Step 4.

    Starting a New Search never overwrites a previously saved search; a new record is created only after reaching Step 4 again.

    Direct links to earlier steps for saved searches redirect to Step 4 with the explanatory notice.

Suggested commit message

Enforce forward-only flow: remove back navigation; treat any back action as New Search; keep save-at-Step-4 policy; maintain fresh results and clean UI on Step 4.
