1) Always-available Home button

    Put a clear “Home” button in the header that’s visible on every screen (including all wizard steps and vacancy viewer).

    Tapping Home should take the user to their dashboard / home page.

    Do not lose progress when going Home. If they return to the wizard, they should land on the exact step and vacancy they left off.

    After logout, take users back to the login screen as before.

2) Apply only once per vacancy, and only if it still exists

I want hard guarantees that users won’t apply twice to the same vacancy, and that we only apply to vacancies that are still available on HH.ru.

Behavior I want:

    Before sending an application, the app should:

        Verify the vacancy still exists on HH.ru (use the vacancy detail endpoint; if HH returns “not found/archived” or similar, show a friendly message and skip).
        GitHub

        Check if we’ve already applied to this vacancy with this user (use HH “negotiations/responses” data to detect an existing response for the same vacancy; if one exists, mark it as Already applied and disable the Apply button).
        GitHub
        Speca

    If a vacancy requires a mandatory test or is a direct type that HH does not allow applying to via API, show a short message like:
    “This vacancy can’t be applied to through the API,” and disable Apply.
    Speca

    Handle resumed sessions: when a user comes back days later and hits Continue → Apply, the app must re-check the vacancy status on HH.ru right before applying. If it’s gone, show a friendly notice (“This vacancy has been removed”) and move them to the next available vacancy.
    GitHub

    Keep our own per-user record of applied vacancy IDs so the UI can instantly label items as Applied even before talking to HH; but HH should remain the source of truth (if HH shows an existing response, we respect that and prevent duplicates).
    GitHub

UI copy (plain language):

    On vacancies:

        Button states: Apply, Applied, Not available, Requires test

        Messages:

            “You already applied to this job.”

            “This job is no longer available.”

            “This job requires a test. Applying via the API isn’t supported.”
            Speca

    On resume/continue:

        If the current vacancy disappeared, show a one-line banner and automatically jump to the next one.

Success checklist:

    The Home button is always visible and safe to click at any time; returning to the wizard restores the exact step and vacancy.

    Trying to apply twice to the same vacancy is blocked every time (both by our local record and by checking HH negotiations/responses).

    Right before any apply action, the app confirms the vacancy still exists via HH; missing/archived jobs never get an application sent.
    GitHub

    Vacancies that require a mandatory test (or are unsupported “direct” types) clearly show that API apply isn’t possible.
    Speca

If something is unclear, please choose the simplest approach that keeps things private, reliable, and in everyday language.
