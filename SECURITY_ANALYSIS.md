# Gemini API Key Security Analysis

## Current Implementation Status: ✅ SECURE

### Key Storage Location
- **Environment Variable**: `GEMINI_API_KEY` stored in server environment variables only
- **Location**: `server/services/aiClient.ts` line 3
- **Access**: Server-only, never exposed to client-side code

### Security Verification

#### 1. Server-Only Storage ✅
```typescript
// server/services/aiClient.ts
const apiKey = process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY || '';
```
- API key is read from server environment variables
- Never stored in database, files, or client-accessible locations

#### 2. Never Sent to Client ✅
- No API endpoints return the key
- No client-side code has access to the key
- Key is not included in any JSON responses

#### 3. No Logging of Key ✅
```typescript
if (!apiKey) {
  console.error('GEMINI_API_KEY not found in environment variables');
} else {
  console.log('Gemini API key loaded, length:', apiKey.length); // Only logs LENGTH
}
```
- Only the key length is logged, never the actual key value
- Error messages don't expose the key

#### 4. Encryption at Rest
- **Status**: Environment variables are handled by Replit's secure environment system
- **Cipher**: Managed by Replit infrastructure (platform-level encryption)
- **Access**: Only authorized project collaborators can access environment variables

### Network Security
- API key is only sent directly to Google's Gemini API endpoints via HTTPS
- No intermediate storage or transmission through insecure channels

### Code Analysis
- ✅ No client-side API key access
- ✅ No database storage of key
- ✅ No file system storage of key  
- ✅ No logging of actual key value
- ✅ Proper error handling without key exposure

## Test Coverage Required
A unit test should verify that:
1. Client network requests never contain the API key
2. Server logs never contain the actual key value
3. Error responses don't leak key information
